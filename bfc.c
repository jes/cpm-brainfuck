/* A Semi-literate Brainfuck Compiler for CP/M
  
   James Stanley 2020
   james@incoherency.co.uk
  
   The compiler itself should be relatively portable, although the generated
   code squarely targets CP/M. I think it only generates 8080 code but I have
   not tested it on anything other than a Z80.
  
   Compile it within CP/M using the HI-TECH C Compiler:
   C>C -V E:BFC.C
  
   Then you can compile a Brainfuck program:
   C>BFC E:HELLO.BF
  
   And then you can execute the generated program written to E:HELLO.COM:
   C>E:HELLO

   This is my first attempt at anything resembling literate programming. I
   hope you enjoy.

/* 30000 bytes of program memory is typical for Brainfuck interpreters.

   The address space layout for the generated program will look like this:

   +-------------+-----------------------+----------------------+-------------+-----+------+------+
   | 0x00 - 0xff | code (unknown length) | memory (30000 bytes) | ... gap ... |  unknown - 0xffff |
   +-------------+-----------------------+----------------------+-------------+-----+------+------+
   | Low storage |                   Transient Program Area                   | CCP | BDOS | BIOS |
   +-------------+------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+

   I wanted to offer all of the available memory in the Transient Program Area,
   up to the start of the CCP, and while older versions of CP/M appeared to
   offer a BDOS call which would report the base address of the CCP, there is
   no such call available in CP/M 2.2 as far as I can tell, so we just stick
   with the standard 30K bytes.

   There is no bounds-checking on memory accesses, so in principle the entire
   TPA *is* available to the generated program, but cells past 30000 will not
   be zeroed in the preamble. */
