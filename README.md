# A Semi-literate Brainfuck Compiler for CP/M

### By James Stanley

In this repository you can find:

 - `bfc.c`: The compiler itself, with inline explanations. You should read this. It is intended
   to be an essay as much as a program.
 - Various example Brainfuck programs which I ripped off from others.

I recommend using the HI-TECH C Compiler, I got it from http://www.z80.eu/c-compiler.html
and installed it using instructions from https://techtinkering.com/2008/10/22/installing-the-hi-tech-z80-c-compiler-for-cpm/ .

If you want to contact me please email james@incoherency.co.uk.

Cheers.
